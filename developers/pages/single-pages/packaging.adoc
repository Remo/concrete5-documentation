= Including in Packages

If you haven't, check out the documentation on packaging a theme here: <<design_packages_overview>>.
Here you'll learn the ins and outs on the Concrete5 package format, a package's Controller file and get up to speed quickly.

Once you have your package's Controller file created, it's a simple matter to add support for your custom single page and its controller to the package.
For this example, we'll assume we're creating a single page at /dashboard/system/game/

Create a single_pages and controllers directories within your package's directory.

----
mkdir packages/game_system
mkdir packages/game_system/single_pages
mkdir packages/game_system/single_pages/dashboard
mkdir packages/game_system/single_pages/dashboard/system
mkdir packages/game_system/controllers
mkdir packages/game_system/controllers/single_page
mkdir packages/game_system/controllers/single_page/dashboard
mkdir packages/game_system/controllers/single_page/dashboard/system
----

Create a controller file for your package as per the theming instructions listed above, at packages/game_system/controller.php.

Create your single page at packages/game_system/single_pages/dashboard/system/game.php.

Create the controller at packages/game_system/controllers/single_page/dashboard/system/game.php.
Make sure it has the proper namespace (NOT beginning with Application)

[source,php]
----
<?

namespace Concrete\Package\GameSystem\Controller\SinglePage\Dashboard\System;

use Concrete\Core\Page\Controller\DashboardPageController;

class Game extends DashboardPageController
{
}
----

Add a refernece to the \Concrete\Core\Page\Single class to the top of your controller.

[source,php]
----
use Concrete\Core\Page\Single as SinglePage;
----

In your package's install() method, install your single page using the http://concrete5.org/api/class-Concrete.Core.Page.Single.html#_add[Concrete\Core\Page\Single::add()] method.

[source,php]
----
public function install()
{
    $pkg = parent::install();
    SinglePage::add('/dashboard/system/game', $pkg);
}
