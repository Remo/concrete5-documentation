= Disabling in Edit Mode & Clipboard View

While most blocks can coexist with Concrete5's editing environment without issue, it can be useful to display a different view layer for a block while a page is in edit mode.
Perhaps your block employs some custom CSS that places its z-index higher than Concrete5's edit layer, or it uses Flash or other technologies that don't always work well with our overlay.
Maybe its JavaScript and Concrete5's JavaScript conflict.
In these cases, it's useful to disable your block's view in edit mode.
Here's how the YouTube block does it.

[source,php]
----
<?php
$c = Page::getCurrentPage();
if ($c->isEditMode()) { ?>
    <div
        class="ccm-edit-mode-disabled-item"
        style="width: <?php echo $vWidth; ?>px; height: <?php echo $vHeight; ?>px;"
    >
        <div style="padding:8px 0px; padding-top: <?php echo round($vHeight / 2) - 10; ?>px;">
            <?php echo t('YouTube Video disabled in edit mode.'); ?>
        </div>
    </div>
<? } else { ?>
    <!-- YouTube contents here -->
<? } ?>
----

This is pretty self-explanatory.
We use the current page object, and then we display disabled content within the "ccm-edit-mode-disabled-item."

== Clipboard

The "Add from Clipboard" view from the Add Panel attempts to render the view layer of each block that appears within it, and this can also lead to problems.
For example, if a block has a problem displaying its contents with multiple instances on a page, this could be a problem.
To fix this, simply include a file named "scrapbook" in your block's folder.
This file will be used when the block is rendered in the Add Panel, as opposed to the view.php file.

=== Example

The HTML block is an excellent example of using a custom clipboard template.
Since anything can be in the HTML block, and this could lead to problems, we sanitize the view when the HTML block is rendered in the clipboard.
From concrete/blocks/html/scrapbook.php:

[source,php]
----
<?php defined('C5_EXECUTE') or die('Access Denied.'); ?>

<div id="HTMLBlock<?php echo intval($bID); ?>" class="HTMLBlock" style="max-height: 300px; overflow: auto;">
    <?php echo Concrete\Block\Html\Controller::xml_highlight(($content)); ?>
</div>
----

The contents are highlighted nicely, and are guaranteed to not impact any other blocks rendered in the panel at the same time.
