= Screencast: Building an Audio Player

In the following screencast, we'll build a custom Concrete5 block from scratch.
You'll see how to create a block controller and form, how to use block data in the block's view, and we'll learn about some new concepts too, including:

* Registering and Requiring CSS and JavaScript Assets in Your Block's View Layer
* Loading custom JavaScript in your block's view layer.
* Placing a Block Type in a particular block type set (displayed in the Add Panel)
* Interacting with the File Manager
