= Grouping Block Types into Sets

In Concrete5 5.7 we introduced the concept of Block Type sets.
Each Block Type can appear in a set, which will group it with similar block types in the add block user interface.

The following sets are available in 5.7 by default.
Currently, there is no way to add your own, but that may change in the future.

* Basics
* Navigation
* Forms
* Social Networking
* Multimedia

To make sure your block type appears in the right set, just add this protected variable to its controller class

[source,php]
----
protected $btDefaultSet = 'your_set';
----

Where your_set is one of the following (to correspond with the list above):

* basic
* navigation
* form
* social
* multimedia

That's all you have to do! (Note, if you previously installed your block type without a set, you'll have to remove it and reinstall it for the new set to take effect.)
