= Working with Blocks

Blocks are the foundation behind everything that a Concrete5 website visitor sees that can also be edited through the CMS.
There are over thirty block types installed with the default Concrete5 site, and they encompass functionality from in-page rich text, multimedia elements like video and image sliders, and even interactive elements like forms and surveys.
Blocks can easily be placed and edited by site editors, and likewise can easily be extended and even built from scratch by a developer.
Here's everything you need to know about working with Concrete5 blocks, whether you want to do something as simple as modify the HTML a block outputs or dive into something more advanced, like creating your own custom block type.
