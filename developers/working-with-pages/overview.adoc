= Overview

The http://concrete5.org/api/class-Concrete.Core.Page.Page.html[Concrete\Core\Page\Page] object is one of the most commonly used throughout Concrete5.
Pages are the entry point to a site, and with custom attributes can store lots of information that developers might want to access.
Additionally, operations as simple as printing out the date a page was created or the name of a page require understanding how to retrieve and operate on the page object.

== Retrieving the Current Page Object

=== From within a Page Template

Within a page template (e.g. a template file found in a theme or a single page template) you don't have to do anything to retrieve the current page object.
It's already present in the local scope:

[source,php]
----
$c
----

(The `$c` stands for "current page.")

=== From within a Block Template

The $c object isn't always available in a block's view or edit template.
Instead, use this snippet of code to retrieve the current page:

[source,php]
----
$c = \Page::getCurrentPage();
----

== Getting a Page By Path or ID

Sometimes you want to operate on a page that you know exists in a certain spot on the tree.

[source,php]
----
$c = \Page::getByPath('/path/to/page', 'APPROVED');
----

Similarly, if you know the exact numerical ID of the page you want to work with, use this code:

[source,php]
----
$c = \Page::getByID(HOME_CID, 'APPROVED'); // Retrieves the home page.
----

Once you have a page object, there's a lot you can do with it.

=== Retrieving the Most Recent Page Object

The examples above return the page object and load the approved http://concrete5.org/api/class-Concrete.Core.Page.Collection.Version.Version.html[Page Version] object for that page.
Most of the time this is right, ensuring that you're displaying information from the approved version of the page you're interested in.
Sometimes, however, a developer might want to retrieve the most recent version of the page, rather than the approved one.
To do so, just omit the version specifier.

[source,php]
----
$c = \Page::getByPath('/path/to/page');
Â 
$c = \Page::getByID(HOME_CID);
----
