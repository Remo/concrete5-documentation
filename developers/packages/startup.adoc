= Modifying the Concrete5 Startup Routine from a Package

In addition to installing things like block types and themes, packages can inject custom code into the Concrete5 bootstrap routine.
This can be very useful.
For example, a statistics package might want to use the `on_page_view` event to track when pages are viewed and do something with that information.
Hooking into the event is easy:

[source,php]
----
\Events::addListener(
    'on_page_view',
    function ($e) {
        $c = $e->getPageObject();
        // do something with the current page object
    });
);
----

To make this event listener code run during the Concrete5 bootstrap routine, simply create a method in the controller.php named `on_start()` and add it there:

[source,php]
----
public function on_start()
{
    \Events::addListener(
        'on_page_view',
        function ($e) {
            $c = $e->getPageObject();
           // do something with the current page object
        }
   );
}
----

Now, this code will run every time Concrete5 runs - but only if this particular package is installed.
