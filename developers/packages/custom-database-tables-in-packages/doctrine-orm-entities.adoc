= Doctrine ORM Entities

NOTE: Requires Concrete5 5.7.4 or above

Finally, a completely new way of handling custom database tables is available in Concrete5.
This is done by not using database tables at ALL! (At least, not directly)
Instead, create Doctrine entity classes, which are PHP classes marked up by custom comments (hereafter called annotations).
If these classes are marked up properly, they will automatically generate database tables in the background and can be used with Doctrine ORM as "entities."

== Requirements

This approach requires that a developer be very familiar with http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html[Doctrine 2 and its ORM component].

== Example

Let's say I'm creating a statistics package, and I want to create a table to store User Agents â€“ the string of text that identifies a web browser viewing a page.
Instead of treating this like a database table, I'll treat it like an "entity object" instead.
An entity object is simply a PHP object containing data about something.

First, create a PHP object storing the thing you want.

=== File: packages/statistics/src/Entity/UserAgent.php

[source,php]
----
<?php

namespace Concrete\Package\Statistics\Src\Entity;

class UserAgent
{
    protected $id;

    protected $value;

    protected $hash;

    public function getValue()
    {
        return $this->value;
    }

    public function setValue($value)
    {
        $this->value = $value;
    }

    public function getID()
    {
        return $this->$id;
    }

    public function getHash()
    {
        return $this->hash;
    }

    public function setHash($hash)
    {
        $this->hash = $hash;
    }
}
----

To turn this into a Doctrine ORM entity, just add annotations above the relevant class and variables.

[source,php]
----
<?php

namespace Concrete\Package\Statistics\Src\Entity;

/**
 * @Entity
 * @Table(name="StatisticsUserAgents")
 */
class UserAgent
{

    /**
     * @Id @Column(type="integer")
     * @GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @Column(type="string")
     */
    protected $value;

    /**
     * @Column(type="string")
     */
    protected $hash;
----

Now, when my package is installed, the table `StatisticsUserAgents` will automatically be created.
I can then use Doctrine ORM to persist my data as described within its documentation.
This approach also seamlessly handles periodic schema changes.
