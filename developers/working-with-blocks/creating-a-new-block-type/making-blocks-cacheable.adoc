= Making Blocks Cacheable for Better Performance

By default, any time a block view is rendered in a page, the following takes place:

. The block ID, area name and page ID is retrieved from the Database.
. Using this data, the information from the block's $btTable is retrieved dynamically.
. The view() method from the block's controller is run.
. The view.php or custom template PHP file for that block instance is included.

Some block's require this level of dynamic processing, but many don't.
For those, it doesn't make sense to run through all these steps every time the block is rendered, on every page.
Instead, block's can be made cacheable, in various levels.

To make a block cacheable, simply add any of the following protected class variables to your block's controller.

== Variables

`**$btCacheBlockRecord;**` +
This defaults to true, meaning that it is enabled for block types by default.
When this is set to true, step 2 in the list above is not necessary.
Instead, the $btTable record data will be stored with the block record in step 1, and will automatically be cached and retrieved.
*This can almost always be set to true.*

`**$btCacheBlockOutput**` +
Defaults to false.
When block caching is enabled, enabling this boolean means that the output of the block will be saved and delivered without running steps 3 and 4 above.
*This means view() will not run.*

`**$btCacheBlockOutputLifetime**` +
Defaults to no time limit (0).
When block caching is enabled and output caching is enabled for a block, this is the value in seconds that the cache will last before being refreshed.

`**$btCacheBlockOutputOnPost**` +
Defaults to false.
This determines whether a block will cache its output on POST.
Some blocks can cache their output but must serve uncached output on POST in order to show error messages, etcâ€¦

`**$btCacheBlockOutputForRegisteredUsers**` +
Defaults to false.
Determines whether a block that can cache its output will continue to cache its output even if the current user viewing it is logged in.

== Refresh Note

When changing any of these parameters in your block type, make sure to refresh your block type via Dashboard > Stacks & Blocks > Block Types.
Click on the block type in the list and click refresh. Otherwise the block type record won't be aware that its cache settings have changed.
