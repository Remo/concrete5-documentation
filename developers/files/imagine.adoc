= Using the Imagine Image Library to Work with Images

Concrete5 includes the https://imagine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/[Imagine Image Processing Library] for working with images.
Imagine is a OOP library for image manipulation built in PHP 5.3 using the latest best practices and thoughtful design.
Imagine is accessible through the Image class:

[source,php]
----
$imagine = \Image::open('/path/to/image.jpg');
----

That's it.
Now you have an instance of an object of the \Imagine\Image\ImageInterface interface.
You can read more about what you can do with this object https://imagine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/introduction.html[in Imagine's documentation].

Using Imagine to work on a Concrete5 File object is easy.

[source,php]
----
$file = File::getByID(3);
$version = $file->getApprovedVersion();
$resource = $version->getFileResource();
$image = Image::load($resource->read());
----

== Example: Take a File object, load a new version, Transform the Image and Save It

Note: this requires 7.5 or greater

[source,php]
----
$portrait = File::getByID(10);
$version = $file->getVersionToModify(true); //forces the retrieval of a new version
$resource = $version->getFileResource();
$image = Image::load($resource->read());

// Now let's perform some manipulations to the image.
$image->effects()->negative()->gamma(1.3);

// Now let's update the image
$version->updateContents($image->get());
----

If you're on a version before 5.7.5, the API is a little more cumbersome.
Instead of simply calling updateContents() (a new method in 5.7.5), you'll have to call this instead:

[source,php]
----
// Now let's update the image
$storage = $version->getFile()->getFileStorageLocationObject();
$cf = Core::make('helper/concrete/file');
if (is_object($storage)) {
    $storage->getFileSystemObject()->write($cf->prefix($version->getPrefix(), $version->getFilename()), $image->get());
    $version->refreshAttributes();
}
----

That's it.
The contents of the new file version are now the modified image contents.
